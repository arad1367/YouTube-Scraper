A bunch of people learned a bunch of skills directly applicable after the war and the facilities and capital stuff can probably be switched to be used for useful stuff later. 

Modern weapons aren't like that at all. Hyper specialized fiddly equipment made slowly and expensively at dedicated facilities built in peace time (which don't seem to be able to scale up very well when a war actually happens). They can't even turn the line off because then the capacity fades away almost immediately. Drone production and infantry equipment seems to have been the only thing that can actually scale. Like neither side has been able to scale up simple artillery shell production to necessary levels in 3 years.",63,2025-06-20T16:53:40Z,vl156QpXr5g,The Impact of War on Markets and the Economy

But GDP might be a misleading metric in this case.

Much better suited to measure economic prosperity (particularly in this case) would be NDP (net domestic product).

NDP = GDP minus depreciation of assets.
Therefore, NDP takes into account all the assets lost because of war, such as destroyed houses or infrastructure (as well as destroyed fighting vehicles etc.).
And frankly, I don't see how an acitivity that acively destroys assets can  be ultimately beneficial to the combined NDP of all combatants.",32,2025-06-20T18:23:36Z,vl156QpXr5g,The Impact of War on Markets and the Economy

Normalized (Or Core) GDP takes out Net Exports and Gov Spending and is more recurring or organic.

In the United States, a small fraction—roughly 2% of the population—controls the majority of the nation’s wealth. Yet, they often do little to alleviate the struggles of those less fortunate. Instead, they insist that the government bears that responsibility, all while exploiting loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of taxes—overlooking the reality that their fortunes were built on the labor, consumption, and trust of the very people they neglect.",30,2025-09-11T17:20:36Z,49RT6SQ8n0Y,"Ray Dalio: We’re Heading Into Very, Very Dark Times!

I do find it annoying that the corporations basically make Government Policy, hence why none pay the Taxes levels they should do. Hence why their is so much corruption at the top. 

Instead it does feel to me the Government always comes after us, whether it to pay their Taxes or fight their wars. And now when we die, they still come after us, so we can't make life a tad easier for our families we leave behind.

Human nature makes people less caring whether Rich or Poor. Neighbours won't even lend a hand to other neighbours in most cases.

Oh, it's such a complicated question. How do you get people to do things they don't really wanna do in an economy?

It's such a hard question to answer.

I dunno Ray? Maybe pay people a living wage for their labor?

Maybe it would be alright if Ray took a 10-15% hit on his untaxed dividends and that money could go towards raises for any employee working anywhere he has ownership. You know, so they could at least afford groceries?

That also increases tax revenue as the money ends up in payroll. Paying into social security.

You wanna know why the system is failing?

It cannot afford to continue to feed the greed of men like the one on the screen.

That's it. Everything crumbling because men like him have taken so much and given so little back.

The word ""conspiracy"" originates from the Latin word conspirare, which literally means ""to breathe together"".
 This etymology reflects the notion that people who conspire are united in thought and action, so closely aligned that they are metaphorically described as breathing in unison.
 The concept extends beyond the literal act of breathing, symbolizing a deep harmony and shared commitment, often described as ""thinking in harmony"".
 This shared breath represents a collective purpose, whether for positive or negative ends, and is central to the word's original meaning of agreement or unity.",1,2025-08-06T23:28:25Z,ZxZO0jd8VoU,BlackRock: The Conspiracies You Don’t Know

UgwsufNEODHMDPV9mH54AaABAg,@karlvonbahnhof6594,"I asked AI 
""What would be the consequences, if USA took over Greenland, analyze it and tell me your opinion?""

""In January 2026, intensified rhetoric from the Trump administration regarding the annexation of Greenland ""one way or the other"" has led experts and world leaders to analyze the potential for a catastrophic breakdown in international relations.

Geopolitical Consequences

Dissolution of NATO: Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and other European leaders have warned that a forced U.S. takeover would effectively end NATO. Attacking a fellow member state would violate the core principle of collective defense.

Global Isolation: The U.S. would likely face condemnation from the UN General Assembly and lose its moral authority on the world stage. Allies such as France, Germany, and the UK have issued joint statements affirming Greenland's sovereignty.

Closure of Foreign Bases: Analysts suggest that European nations might retaliate by closing critical U.S. military bases in their territories, severely hampering U.S. power projection in the Middle East and the High North.

Economic and Security Impacts

Market Instability: Threats of annexation have already caused concern among institutional investors, with some Danish pension funds reassessing their holdings of U.S. Treasuries.

Strategic Overreach: While the U.S. seeks Greenland for its vast mineral wealth (including rare earth oxides) and its position in the ""Golden Dome"" missile defense system, critics argue these goals could be achieved through continued diplomacy rather than a costly occupation.

Internal Unrest: Domestically, such an ""unlawful order"" could trigger a constitutional crisis, potential military resignations, and widespread public protests within the U.S..

Analysis and Opinion

In my opinion, a forced takeover of Greenland would be a strategic catastrophe for the United States. While the Arctic’s melting ice makes its resources more accessible, the ""realist"" case for acquisition is undermined by the fact that the U.S. already maintains the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland under existing agreements.

The cost of alienating Europe—traditionally the bedrock of American security—outweighs any perceived gain from territory that 85% of Greenlanders do not wish to yield to the U.S.. Instead of securing the Arctic, such an action would likely create a power vacuum that Russia and China would exploit, leading to a more dangerous and unstable ""New Cold War"".""",1,2026-01-11T10:21:28Z,QoDs05eFwLA,How the U.S. Could Take Control of Greenland — And Why NATO Is Nervous #trump #greenland #nato

Ukraine was an Israel war several years in the making, all the players vitrually Israel people, and begun in order to distract Russia from coming to the aid of its allies Syria and Iran.  The use of Ukrainian mercenaries to overthrow Al Assad at a time when Ukraine was supposed to be fighting Russia should have made it absolutely obvious who was behind that war.  The attack on Iran failed and Netanyahu had given up after the 12 day war, so then the Ukraine war wasn't important anymore, so Trump was instructed to abandon it.

The current stand off with Iran is the result of the failure of Israels attempt at regime change by inserting 3500 Mossad assets trained in Albania with 40 000 Stalink terminals for command and control.  They were horrified when China jammed them all and they couldn't organise them, and as a consequence Israel failed.
Now Trump has been ordered to send US forces into the region and if anyone thinks Netanyahu gives a rats ass about a wider conflict or what might happen to the West then you are naive to the point of stupidity.

Nixon abandoned Bretton Woods because he saw the imminent collapse of the US dollar.

Nixon played Ace card ;   carte blance Security and sale of top grade of military equipment, technology and ground troops in Suadi Arabia in Xchange for Saudi guaranteeing to trade Crude and products to all Countries  Only for US Dollars.  That was the genesis of the petro dollar, 1974.

Today Trump is staring at the imminancy of most of the rest of the World abandoning the USA and Israel in World Trade and using  their own currencies and a New BRICS Currency and CIPS as opposed to SWIFT and abandoning the US dollar wholesale.

Given this imminent and impending scenario; Israel will collapse economically near 100%.  

USA (5% of World population) will no longer will be available to consume 45% of (real goods/produce for xchange of US dollars(just paper and only of value when the petrol dollar ...a means of xchange is active but not when the trading World has abandoned it)

The US will survive at a  hugely reduced to a skeleton of what she was but will need resources within its own Sovereignity. 
US will have to survive at a ""cave age"" level with internal economy.
